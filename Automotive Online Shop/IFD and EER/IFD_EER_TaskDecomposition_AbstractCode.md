+ Model year should include century digits
+ Vehicle cannot be returned for any public search results or be sold if it has any parts pending or not installed
+ If no vehicles meet the search criteria of Vehicle Search form, then a message should be displayed: "Sorry, it looks like we don’t have that in stock!"
+ Vehicle search results should be sorted by VIN in ascending order
+ The fuel type of the vehicle is also tracked, which can be one of the following: Gas, Diesel, Natural Gas, Hybrid, Plugin Hybrid, Battery, or Fuel Cell.
