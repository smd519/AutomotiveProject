# The Goal
This project is a simple web application designed to help a car dealership, Auto Hop, efficiently manage its inventory, financial data, and customer interactions. The main features are:
+ The dealership team can update their inventory when buying and selling used cars and track important financial information depending on their role.
+ It also provides a search feature for customers visiting the showroom to explore available vehicles.
+ Additionally, the app generates reports that help the dealership owner monitor business performance and make data-driven decisions for growth.
Given the limited staff resources, the application stores only essential car details (without pictures) in the database.
