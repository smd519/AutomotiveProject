## 1. [Analytics Modeling For Warranty Analysis](https://github.com/smd519/AutomotiveProject/tree/main/Analytics%20Modeling%20For%20Warranty%20Analysis)
This Analytics Modeling Project focuses on the application of data analytics within the automotive industry, specifically analyzing warranty claims and auto service data to assess the quality and reliability of both hardware and software components in vehicles. The project takes a conceptual approach, emphasizing how these service data points can provide valuable insights for improving product performance and customer satisfaction. By identifying trends and patterns in warranty claims and service records, the project demonstrates how manufacturers can proactively address issues, enhance product design, and optimize service processes. The focus is on the strategic framework for integrating data analytics into automotive service management, rather than on coding or implementation.
